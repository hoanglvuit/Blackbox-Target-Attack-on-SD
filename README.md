# Prompt Manipulation for Targeted Adversarial Object Generation in Stable Diffusion

Image generation is a prominent application of AI, increasingly powered by advanced text-to-image (T2I) models such as Stable Diffusion (SD). However, their adversarial robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel black-box attack that uses simple search algorithms, i.e.,beam search and genetic algorithm, to append five inconspicuous characters to a prompt. This enables the generation of a target object while preserving the original object, evading basic sensitive-content filters.
